# Allocated-Project_Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
The goal of sentiment analysis using NLP is to automatically categorize text into sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral), providing insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and market trends. This process enhances customer experience, aids in brand monitoring, and enables real-time social media analysis for timely responses. 

The dataset employed for this project is derived from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140/code. 
It encompasses details such as:
texts labeled with sentiments (Sentiment column). Text features include the textual content, capturing sentiment information. Text-specific details such as language, sentiment strength, and sentiment source. User-related details such as account age, interaction frequency, and posting behavior. Please note that the features in the sentiment analysis NLP dataset are distinct from those in the Telco Customer Churn dataset, reflecting the specific context of sentiment analysis.

## Methodology
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the sentiment analysis model's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Thorough data cleaning procedures are implemented, addressing issues such as removing special characters, handling missing values, and standardizing text format. This ensures a clean and consistent dataset for subsequent analysis.

## Feature Engineering
To prepare the text data for analysis, various preprocessing techniques are applied, including tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. These steps enhance the efficiency of the sentiment analysis model.

## Feature Scaling
Textual features are extracted from the preprocessed data to represent the information in a format suitable for machine learning models. Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings may be employed for feature extraction.

## Data Imbalance
State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), are considered for sentiment analysis tasks. Model selection is based on factors like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Preprocessing Function
When performing sentiment analysis on textual data, a preprocessing function is crucial to clean and transform the raw text into a format suitable for analysis. Below is an example of a basic preprocessing function for sentiment analysis in NLP using Python. 

## Models Training
The chosen sentiment analysis model is trained on the labeled training data using appropriate training techniques and algorithms. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize model performance.


```python
# Example code snippet (assuming 'X_train' is the feature matrix and 'y_train' is the target variable)
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Instantiate the BERT tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize and prepare the input data
X_train_tokenized = tokenizer(X_train, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=256, return_tensors='pt')
X_test_tokenized = tokenizer(X_test, truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=256, return_tensors='pt')

# Assuming 'y_train' is the target variable
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train)

# Train the BERT model
model.train(input_ids=X_train_tokenized['input_ids'], attention_mask=X_train_tokenized['attention_mask'], labels=y_train_tensor)

# Make predictions on the test data
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**X_test_tokenized)
    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)

# Evaluate the model
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
